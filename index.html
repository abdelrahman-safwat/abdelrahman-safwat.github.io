    <h2><a href="https://github.com/AhmedSayedOmar/Motion_prediction-team">Graduation Project</a></h2>
    <p>I worked on this graduation project at Purdue. Some needed context is that there is a race called the Indy Autonomous Race or IAC. The IAC is a race between between universities, each university is given a full sized formula style AV21 (recently AV24) vehicle. All cars are identical hardware wise. The vehicles are unmanned, and the difference is in the software to make the vehicles autonomous self driving. There is a full team of people working on Purdue's car and our graduation project was just a small part of that bigger team.\n\nWe worked on Motion prediction of opponent vehicles, A machine learning project utilizing transformers on pre-trained models (module 1), Gaussian Process for real time motion prediction (module 2). We also worked on overtaking strategies trajectories (module 3). I was more involved in the motion prediction aspect.</p>
